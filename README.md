# hello-world
My name is Caitlyn.
My favourite colour is blue, and my favourite sweet is butterscotch.
I've been binging the She-Ra remake lately, and my favourite character so far is Catra. I think the character designs are way better than the ones from the '80s version of the show.
My hobbies are art and writing.
I want to make an expansive, plot heavy rpg when I've learned enough about programming
